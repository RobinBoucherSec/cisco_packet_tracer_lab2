## üéØ Objectives

- Design and set up a multi-building network using Cisco Packet Tracer.

- Configure local services (DHCP, DNS, FTP, Web) in each building.

- Interconnect all buildings using routers and proper IP addressing.

- Test and verify full network connectivity across all sites.

- Apply basic security settings on network devices.

- Documentation, and troubleshooting skills.

## üîß Tools Used

- Cisco Packet Tracer
  
- Simulating these devices: Routers, Switches, PCs, Servers

- Services Configured: DHCP, DNS, FTP, Web

- Routing Used: Static Routing

  
## üí° Skills Learned

- Use of Cisco Packet Tracer

- Configuration of network services (DHCP, DNS, FTP, Web)

- IP addressing and subnets (IPv4)

- Router configuration (CLI, static routes, security)

- Connectivity testing (ping, DNS, FTP, Web)

- Network troubleshooting and error correction

- Basic network device security
- 


## Key Takeaways and Technical Insights

This project allowed us to apply networking and security knowledge by simulating a complex, multi-site infrastructure. We used Cisco Packet Tracer to configure routers and servers (DHCP, DNS, FTP, Web) and establish connectivity using static routing . It improved our skills in IP addressing , network configuration , troubleshooting , device security , and team collaboration .
